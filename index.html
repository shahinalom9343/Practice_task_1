    <p>It was my charming experience of visited Chandranath Pahar and Guliakhali sea Beach at chittagong within a single day.The Chandranath Pahar is the highest peak of chittagong district.And Guliakhali sea beach is an alluring spot at the bank of the Bay of Bengal which both are situated at sitakunda upozilla.It's the most wonderful one-day visit. Due to mangrove type you will watch a sea beach having grasses in the bank, not the sand. Some people I saw were having their shower too. But definitely you need to consider when the tide comes. Otherwise you will find the waves very far from the grasses. Usually 11 am to 1pm and 5-6 pm is the time when Waves are high. We're in a rush as we needed to visit Chandranath Hill after this. But the 2 hours we spent was worthy enough.</p>
